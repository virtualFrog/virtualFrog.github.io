<p>One of the things that regularly pops up in our health checks in VMware environments are connected CD Drives that prevent DRS from functioning properly or prevents a host from entering maintenance mode when doing thing like patching.</p>
<p>In large environments it can get very tedious to disconnect all those drives manually. With PowerCLI it is just one line.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>If you want to free up a host for maintenance mode you can do it with two lines:</p>
<p>[code language="powershell"]Get-VMHost &lt;your host&gt; |Get-VM | Where-Object {$_.PowerState –eq “PoweredOn”} | Get-CDDrive | Set-CDDrive -NoMedia -Confirm:$False<br />
Get-VMHost &lt;your host&gt;| Set-VMHost -VMHost Host -State &quot;Maintenance&quot;[/code]</p>
<p>If you want to disconnect all of your CD-ROMs:<br />
[code language="powershell"]Get-VM | Where-Object {$_.PowerState –eq “PoweredOn”} | Get-CDDrive | Set-CDDrive -NoMedia -Confirm:$False[/code]</p>
<p>If you just want to list all the VMs that have connected CD Drives:<br />
[code language="powershell"]Get-VM | Where-Object {$_.PowerState –eq “PoweredOn”} | Get-CDDrive | FT Parent, IsoPath[/code]</p>
