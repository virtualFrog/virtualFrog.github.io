The next generation of Onyx is here and itâ€™s called Code Capture , which is only available in the vSphere HTML5 Web Client Fling ! Using the start and stop button on the main menu bar, Code Capture allows you to take your actions in the vSphere Client and output them to PowerCLI code. The code output can also easily be copied and/or downloaded from your browser session using the dedicated buttons in the Code Capture area.
