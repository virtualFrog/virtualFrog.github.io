This morning I got a very cool e-Mail: I was accepted as vExpert 2018. This is a great honor for me and I am very excited about it.

Becoming a vExpert is actually not that difficult. You give back to the community and apply at the end of June (as I just did) or in january. If you are like me and always forget to apply it will probably take you just as long as it took me to get accepted.

There are quite a few benefits you get from being an accepted vExpert. I will tell you how this experience is for me in the coming months so stay tuned.
