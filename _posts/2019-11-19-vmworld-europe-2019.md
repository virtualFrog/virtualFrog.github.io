## The conference

In my first year at [BUSINESS IT](https://www.business-it.ch/) I was allowed to attend VMworld 2019 in Barcelona. This year's VMworld was under the motto "Make your Mark" and as usual this was beautifully staged everywhere.

The [BUSINESS IT](https://www.business-it.ch/) delegation included six people this year. Our CTO Patrik Rogg, our Managing Director Maurizio Campagnaro, our Senior Account Manager Ren√© Gebele, two of our Solution Architects Roger Mafli and Michael Steg and myself:

We arrived on Sunday before VMworld and were then invited to a Swiss partner dinner in the middle of Barcelona. The first evening was dedicated to networking within the Swiss VMware partner scene in a beautiful restaurant.

### [Monday] Day 0: Partner Day

Monday is traditionally the first day of VMworld dedicated to VMware partners. My personal plan was first and foremost the "VCDX Workshop". I learned many things about the highest certification of VMware and gained new courage to face this challenge.

After the workshop the "Partner General Session" was held where the new Partner Program was explained. With currently 4 of 5 Master Services competences [BUSINESS IT](https://www.business-it.ch/) is one of the best VMware partners in the world and we are very proud to have reached this milestone recently. (See:&nbsp;[Master Services Competency Cloud Management and Automation Achiveved](https://virtualfrog.wordpress.com/2019/11/08/master-services-competency-cloud-management-and-automation-achiveved/))

In the evening of the first day the [BUSINESS IT](https://www.business-it.ch/) delegation went for dinner in the port of Barcelona and followed an invitation of another Swiss partner in an atmospheric location with a fantastic view:

### [Tuesday] Day 1: Official Start

On the second day the fair was opened to all visitors and the technical sessions as well as the Solution Exchange were opened. The day started with the "General Session" at which VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger described the new projects around "VMware Tanzu" in more detail. VMware has announced several projects (Galleon & Pacific) which show how modern applications can be built and run efficiently on VMware infrastructure. Very exciting news.

My personal program then had technical sessions on PowerCLI and Extreme Performance.

The VMware Hands-On Labs Challenge "Odyssey" started on Tuesday. It was all about completing certain tasks in a lab environment in as short a time as possible in a team of 3. I took part and my team ("startdusters") could claim the second best time in round 1.

In the evening of the second day Michael Steg and I had a scheduling conflict. We were invited by Veeam to a dinner but had already been invited to the vExpert party one hour before. We tried to keep both dates and went to the vExpert Party first. This took place under the famous "W" hotel and invited us to network with other vExperts from around the world. We had interesting conversations with technicians and the CEO of the German VMware partner "comdivision" and later it turned out that exactly on this day this CEO had his birthday. The announcement was made by VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger, who joined the vExperts party after a "Happy Birthday". Of course we could not resist taking a picture with the very sympathetic CEO of VMware:

After the photo session with Pat, Michael and I went on to the Veeam dinner, where we arrived in time for dinner, despite all the other things.

### [Wednesday] Day 2 : More sessions and news

The third day started again with the "General Session". There was a special guest: Bear Grylls. The author and TV star gave exciting insights into his career and explained his philosophy. This guest contribution was rounded off by live demos and was also very interesting.

My personal plan had again technical sessions around PowerCLI, vSAN and High-Availability in it. Also the second round of the "Odyssey" Challenge took place here. My team had difficulties in this round but thanks to the good time from the first round, we just made it to the semi-finals.

In the evening the "VMFest" was celebrated in the biggest hall. On the program was first "RPJ" as opening act and then "Stereophonics". Both played great and there was a great atmosphere. In the hall there were innumerable catering possibilities and some mobile beer taps.

At the edge of the festival we discovered a photo station where about 12 cameras were set up. With it one could make a moving picture. We took this as an opportunity to celebrate our newest [Master Services competence](https://virtualfrog.wordpress.com/2019/11/08/master-services-competency-cloud-management-and-automation-achiveved/) once again:

### [Thursday] Day 3: Full throttle again

As always, the last day came very quickly. Here again many sessions were held. During one session a new VMware Fling was released: vCenter Event Broker Appliance.

With this Fling it becomes possible to react to events within a vCenter and to run workflows automatically. For example, a use case is to tag a new VM as soon as it is created. A really cool session.

On the last day we continued with the "Odyssey" Challenge. My team prevailed in the semi-final and we were allowed to compete in the final. The final was about "vRealize Automation". Unfortunately our time wasn't the fastest but at least we could secure the third place:

The last day is also always the departure day. It was a great VMworld and I am already looking forward to VMworld 2020, which will take place again in Barcelona from 9th to 12th November 2020.
