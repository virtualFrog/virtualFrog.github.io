<p>One of my colleagues had a problem the other night. He was called to troubleshoot a VMware View environment which was not running as expected. One thing he did during the cleaning up was to get rid of a number of resource pools that were only created for the purpose of putting the VMs into "folders" when viewed from the old C# Client.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>After fixing other errors he was ready to create new linked clones. But they could not power on. The error message said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The available memory resources in the parent resource pool are insufficient for this operation</p></blockquote>
<p>Turns out the hosts had a file in /etc/vmware which referred to the resource pools and was not properly cleaned up. In order to solve this problem the following had to be run on each esxi host:</p>
<blockquote><p>rm /etc/vmware/pools.xml<br />
/etc/init.d/hostd restart<br />
/etc/init.d/vpxa restart</p></blockquote>
<p>After that the VMs were able to power-on as expected and the environment was up and running again.</p>
