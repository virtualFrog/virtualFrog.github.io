#### [vSphere 6.7 U1 API Updates](http://bit.ly/2yJsvKo)

vSphere 6.7 U1 is here and it is fantastic! A fully-featured HTML5 client has been released, along with increased support for NVIDIA vGPU or Intel FPGA associated VMs, plus enhancements to HCI, vSAN, and Content Library. However, Iâ€™m most excited about some of the new API updates and the capabilities they add! For more information The post vSphere 6.7 U1 API Updates appeared first on VMware {code}.
