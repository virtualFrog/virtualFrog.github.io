[Update] Today I am very pleased to announce that two of my fellow teammates have been selected for the vExpert program. This brings our team to a total of **4** vExperts for 2019. In the next round in 2020 I hope that even more of our awesome team will be selected for the program.

The two teammates of mine that made the cut of the second round of vExperts in 2019 are:

- [Michael Steg, Solutions Architect](https://vexpert.vmware.com/directory/4680)
- [Martin Micheelsen, Senior Systems Engineer](https://vexpert.vmware.com/directory/4698)
- [Kai Schwender, Senior Systems Engineer](https://vexpert.vmware.com/directory/4647)

Congratulations to the **three** of them!

What is the vExpert program you ask?

The vExpert program rewards people who contribute to the global VMware community. There are many paths that lead to being a vExpert. Our team here at BUSINESS IT AG has taken the "Partner Path".

The details of the program can be found [here](https://blogs.vmware.com/vexpert/2019/06/07/vexpert-2019-second-half-applications-are-now-open/).

Benefits from being chosen as a vExpert are listed on the vExpert page [here](https://vexpert.vmware.com/). My personal favorite is the Slack channel of vExperts. The vExpert community is by far the most active community out there and the people in there all have a passion to share their knowledge. There is no better place to learn and exchange knowledge.

I hope by 2020 we'll have at least twice as many vExperts in our Professional Services Team at BUSINESS IT AG.

**Update from 30th of July 2019** : Today we received the confirmation that they have accepted the application of yet another member of our team as a vExpert 2019! This brings us to the total of 4 vExperts which is awesome!
