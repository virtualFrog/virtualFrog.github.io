Last year I was fortunate enough to go to VMworld in Barcelona. One of the coolest "goodies" that I brought back was a small NSX book about automating NSX using PowerNSX. What I didn't know at the time was that there were a total of 4 books given away for free (and even signed by the authors!).

<!-- more -->

Thanks to longtime vExpert [Keiran Shelden](https://twitter.com/Keiran_shelden) over at [readysetvirtual.wordpress.com](https://readysetvirtual.wordpress.com/) I learned that those books are available as free downloads.

Wait.. it gets even better! This year there are <del>two</del> **five** new additions to that NSX-knowledge-goodness which will also be distributed (and maybe also signed?) at VMworld. But if you are not able to go to VMworld this year (like me) then you can download them here instead.

Here are the links for all <del>6</del> **9** free NSX books for you to enjoy and learn from:
