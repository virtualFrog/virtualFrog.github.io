<p>Today&nbsp; a new chapter of my professional life started with a new position as Systems Engineer at BUSINESS IT AG in Switzerland.</p>
<p>Almost 4 years ago I have changed jobs and switched from an internal IT position to "Bechtle", a Swiss subsidiary of a big European IT service provider. <!--more-->Bechtle had a very good reputation at the time and I had worked with Bechtle as a customer until then.<br />
Bechtle had a huge potential to become one of Switzerland's, if not one of europe's, most important VMware Partner.</p>
<p>A merger with another Swiss IT service provider two years ago created some conflict of cultures. This caused all of the engineers on the VMware team that I worked with to leave the company for competing firms. We had to go back to square one and tried to find new talents to build up a new VMware team. This proved more challenging than anticipated. Finding good and talented people in such a small country is not easy. After signing some promising engineers the (in my opinion) most crucial new talent left the company after only 7 months. And then at the end of last year my boss also left the company.<br />
I was faced with a decimated team (3 engineers compared to 7 back when I started) and a new boss. All these factors led to my questioning if I still am where I want to be. I have learned a ton at Bechtle and have met many talented people over the last 4 years. I am fundamentally loyal and love my job so changing jobs is a huge thing for me. Being faced with a changing culture and ever less colleagues that where there before the merger left a mark on me. I started to to ask myself if the company values and beliefs still match with mine.</p>
<p>Around that time someone from BUSINESS IT AG who also worked at the Bechtle in Switzerland before my time contacted me. I listened to what he had to say and what they were looking for at BUSINESS IT AG. I was very intrigued and followed up with a visit to their offices in Zurich. I can say we hit it off quickly and I was sold on joining their professional services team. This professional services team consists of eleven engineers and each is an expert in his field.</p>
<p>Today was my first day in this new position and I already love it. I am very much looking forward to working with a great team and doing my part to bring the company to the next level. BUSINESS IT AG is currently Switzerland's best certified VMware partner so getting to the next level still is going to be a challenge.</p>
<p>I left my comfort zone today and I will dive head first into this new challenge. I am very excited to learn a ton of new things and I will write up some blog posts about my new experiences as time permits. Let's get this party started!</p>
