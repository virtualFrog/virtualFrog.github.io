I have been blogging for almost 4 years now. After a slow start back in 2014 and some quiet months every now and then I have published quite a lot of powershell code on here over the years. I have decided to make this code more accessible to everyone who wants to use it and publish it all again on GitHub.

If you are interested in my repository follow this [link](https://github.com/virtualFrog/PowerCLI-Scripts).

It will take some time to get all the scripts out of my blogposts and into the github repository but I will use the chance to improve some of the scripts. The problem with publishing them on this static blog is that when I improved them, I mostly never updated the published blog post again. This will change as I will post scripts only to my Github page from now on.

**Update: all scripts that were published on this blog are now online at my GitHub repository.**
