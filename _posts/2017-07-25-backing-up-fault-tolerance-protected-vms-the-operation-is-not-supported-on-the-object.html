excerpt: How to get rid of the error "the operation is not supported on the object"
---
<p>One of my customers called me up and told me that their VMware Fault-Tolerance (FT) VMs can no longer be backed up. The error it throws says: " The operation is not supported on the object."</p>
<p>When I looked at the recent task&amp;events I was able to see that the backup was successful up to a point where someone reconfigured FT on that VM. So I went into the documentation (<a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.0/com.vmware.vsphere.avail.doc/GUID-F5264795-11DA-4242-B774-8C3450997033.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Link here</a>) and saw that traditional VMware Snapshots are not supported on Fault Tolerance enabled VMs. There is a supported backup method for disk-only snapshots but that only works with the new FT (not legacy FT).</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>New FT was introduced with vSphere 6.0. It enables the hypervisor to protect more than just single-core VMs, which many customers were looking for. Legacy FT is the way FT worked up until vSphere 5.5 where you could only protect a single CPU VMs.</p>
<p>So how did this customer get the message "The operation is not supported on the object" if they were running vSphere 6.0 Update 3? The answer is simple:</p>
<p>They used the C#-Client to do the configuration of FT!</p>
<p>This will create a "legacy Fault Tolerance" configuration for the VM. It makes sense if you read what the C#-Client Interface tells you just before you login: All new features after vSphere 5.1 are only available on the Web-Client. This includes the new FT introduced with vSphere 6.0.</p>
<p>The solution to get rid of the error: Reconfigure the VM for FT in the Web-Client and the backups worked again.</p>
