excerpt: I am once again humbled to be among the accepted into the VMware vExpert
  program 2020.

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There is this day that comes once a year where you get up and have a wonderful mail in your inbox: the acceptance into the vExpert program.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:more --><br />

<!-- /wp:more --></p>

<p>I have been accepted into the program for the third time in row and I am very humbled by this honor.</p>

<p>As a vExpert you get access to a bunch of things. Most useful to me was by far the vExpert Slack channel where every vExpert may join and discuss with peers. I can post any odd technical question in there and I can be sure that some very competent people will take time out of their day to answer and have an exchange of ideas. Due to the vast difference of timezones you can actually post such questions at any time and will have an answer shortly.</p>

<p>The next best thing is a free subscription to the video-learning platform pluralsight. It might not always be the most up-to-date content but good content it is. I have spent countless hours learning new technical skill by watching these videos.</p>

<p>BUSINESS IT, the company I work for has gotten five vExpert applications accepted as of this morning. (In 2019 we had 4) This makes BUSINESS IT once again the most community-contributing partner in Switzerland and I am very proud to be working along such enthusiastic colleagues. I will try and push more guys from our team to share their knowledge within the community and maybe next year we'll have even more vExperts on board.</p>
