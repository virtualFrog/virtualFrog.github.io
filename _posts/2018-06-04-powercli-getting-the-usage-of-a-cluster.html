<p>Our customers sometimes call us in to check their environment. Because this happens quite often we created a basic checklist on what checks we do when we start. One of those checks is a cluster-usage assessment. This helps us further down the road when advising the customer in ways to improve the resilience of his infrastructure.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Now, I know the following script is a "snapshot" of the current usage and does not account for history or even query the vCenter's statistics on a given cluster. But that is okay, because a lot of the time the vCenter does not provide accurate information anyways.</p>
<p>What is still missing from the script is a balancing of host resources. This script basically assumes that all hosts in a cluster are equal in terms of CPU and RAM resources. If they are not the percentage at the end of the script is not very accurate. <strong>A big thanks to <a href="http://www.lucd.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LucD</a> for pointing that out to me</strong>. You can see our discussion on the matter in the VMware communities <a href="https://communities.vmware.com/thread/568844" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Update: this script is now published at <a href="https://github.com/virtualFrog/PowerCLI-Scripts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>.<br />
If I can get around to it I will put some thought into how to address this in the script but in the meantime here it is with the mentioned caveats:</p>
<p>[code language="powershell"]<br />
$clusters = get-cluster<br />
$myClusters = @()<br />
foreach ($cluster in $clusters) {<br />
    $hosts = $cluster |get-vmhost</p>
<p>    [double]$cpuAverage = 0<br />
    [double]$memAverage = 0</p>
<p>    Write-Host $cluster<br />
    foreach ($esx in $hosts) {<br />
        Write-Host $esx<br />
        [double]$esxiCPUavg = [double]($esx | Select-Object @{N = 'cpuAvg'; E = {[double]([math]::Round(($_.CpuUsageMhz) / ($_.CpuTotalMhz) * 100, 2))}} |Select-Object -ExpandProperty cpuAvg)<br />
        $cpuAverage = $cpuAverage + $esxiCPUavg</p>
<p>        [double]$esxiMEMavg = [double]($esx | Select-Object @{N = 'memAvg'; E = {[double]([math]::Round(($_.MemoryUsageMB) / ($_.MemoryTotalMB) * 100, 2))}} |select-object -ExpandProperty memAvg)<br />
        $memAverage = $memAverage + $esxiMEMavg<br />
    }<br />
    $cpuAverage = [math]::Round(($cpuAverage / ($hosts.count) ), 1)<br />
    $memAverage = [math]::Round(($memAverage / ($hosts.count) ), 1)<br />
    $ClusterInfo = "" | Select-Object Name, CPUAvg, MEMAvg<br />
    $ClusterInfo.Name = $cluster.Name<br />
    $ClusterInfo.CPUAvg = $cpuAverage<br />
    $ClusterInfo.MEMAvg = $memAverage<br />
    $myClusters += $ClusterInfo<br />
}<br />
$myClusters<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Here is a picture of the expected output:</p>
