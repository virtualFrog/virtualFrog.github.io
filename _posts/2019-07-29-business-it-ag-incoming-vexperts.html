<p>[Update] Today I am very pleased to announce that two of my fellow teammates have been selected for the vExpert program. This brings our team to a total of <strong>4</strong> vExperts for 2019. In the next round in 2020 I hope that even more of our awesome team will be selected for the program.</p>

<p><!--more--></p>
<p>The two teammates of mine that made the cut of the second round of vExperts in 2019 are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://vexpert.vmware.com/directory/4680" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Steg, Solutions Architect</a></li>
<li><a href="https://vexpert.vmware.com/directory/4698" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Martin Micheelsen, Senior Systems Engineer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://vexpert.vmware.com/directory/4647" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kai Schwender, Senior Systems Engineer</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Congratulations to the <strong>three</strong> of them!</p>
<p>What is the vExpert program you ask?</p>
<p>The vExpert program rewards people who contribute to the global VMware community. There are many paths that lead to being a vExpert. Our team here at BUSINESS IT AG has taken the "Partner Path".</p>
<p>The details of the program can be found <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/vexpert/2019/06/07/vexpert-2019-second-half-applications-are-now-open/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Benefits from being chosen as a vExpert are listed on the vExpert page <a href="https://vexpert.vmware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. My personal favorite is the Slack channel of vExperts. The vExpert community is by far the most active community out there and the people in there all have a passion to share their knowledge. There is no better place to learn and exchange knowledge.</p>
<p>I hope by 2020 we'll have at least twice as many vExperts in our Professional Services Team at BUSINESS IT AG.</p>
<p><strong>Update from 30th of July 2019</strong>: Today we received the confirmation that they have accepted the application of yet another member of our team as a vExpert 2019! This brings us to the total of 4 vExperts which is awesome!</p>
