excerpt: After an open RFP for a BC/DR solution from a well known retail company in
  switzerland we answered with Zerto and won the RFP. I am proud to share the success
  story following this project.

<p>Toady I am proud to share a success story about one of our customers. Two years ago we discussed new requirements that their current BC/DR software was not able to meet.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>After gathering all requirements we helped the customer set up an RFP (Request for Proposal). We answered the RFP with Zerto as their future BC/DR software. Zerto met all their requirements, was extremely easy to install, could scale as easily as it was installed and it has a very robust and clean HTML UI. As a bonus Zerto provides a powerful REST API (which I talked about in a recent post).</p>
<p>After a PoC with Zerto and a competitor product Zerto was selected as the best fit for our customer and we were tasked with the project to write the detailed implementation concept. We ended up combining the implementation of Zerto with a Redesign and Upgrade of their vSphere infrastructure.</p>
<p>The promises Zerto made during the initial offerings held up during the PoC and especially in the rollout across the entire infrastructure.</p>
<p>For any reader speaking german here is the success story our marketing guys have set up about this which includes further details and the customer's point of view.</p>
<p>Update 24th of august 2018: The case study has been updated with a group picture of the people involved in the project.</p>
