<p>A couple of days ago VMware released version 6.5 Update 1 for some of their products:</p>
<ul>
<li>vCenter Server: <a href="https://my.vmware.com/group/vmware/details?downloadGroup=VC65U1&amp;productId=614&amp;rPId=17343" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Link</a></li>
<li>ESXi: <a href="https://my.vmware.com/group/vmware/details?downloadGroup=ESXI65U1&amp;productId=614&amp;rPId=17343" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Link</a>, <a href="https://my.vmware.com/group/vmware/details?downloadGroup=OEM-ESXI65U1-HPE&amp;productId=614" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Link to HPE Custom Image</a></li>
<li>Site Recovery Manager (SRM): <a href="https://my.vmware.com/group/vmware/details?downloadGroup=SRM651&amp;productId=617&amp;rPId=17333" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Link</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I was waiting for Update 1 of the vSphere Stack for a while now, and the List of bugfixes has quite a few entries with critical bug fixes.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2>Installation Update 1 on 6.5 VCSA</h2>
<p>The Update process is incredibly fast. Attach the .iso to your VCSA VM. Go the VAMI (https://&lt;your-vcenter&gt;:5480) and select the Update Tab. Choose to check for Updates on CD-ROM and then install the updates.</p>
<p>After about 4 minutes the installation is done and you'll need to manually reboot the appliance. That's it you're done.</p>
<p>Upgrading from vSphere 6.0 Update 3 is now fully supported with 6.5 Update 1.</p>
<h2>Upgrading ESXi hosts to 6.5 Update 1</h2>
<p>With ESXi hosts there are many roads to choose from.</p>
<ul>
<li>Patch using VMware Update Manager</li>
<li>Upgrade using VMware Update Manager (Upload the iso file)</li>
<li>Re-Install using the latest image and kickstart script</li>
</ul>
<p>In my Lab where we still use HPE G7 hardware (I know, it's not supported, but it still works and it's a lab..) I had a couple of problems. Using the iso with VUM did not work. Next I got a purple screen when doing a fresh install with the latest HPE Image (see link above). The exception was of type 14 (seems to be a page fault according to VMware KBs) so I'm not sure if it's because the hardware is not supported anymore or if I have some hardware issues.</p>
<p>Anyways, I'll be working on that and I'm sure I'll get it to work and update my findings here.</p>
<h2>Upgrading SRM to 6.5 Update 1</h2>
<p>For this upgrade to work you'll need to be on the 6.1.2 Build at least. Upgrading from a 6.0 Installation is not supported because you will run into problems. See the <a href="https://t.co/3NRHCLZbOS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Release Notes</a> for further details.</p>
