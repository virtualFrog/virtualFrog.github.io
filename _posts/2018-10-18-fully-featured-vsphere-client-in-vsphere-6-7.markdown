#### [Fully Featured vSphere Client in vSphere 6.7...](http://bit.ly/2yH1IgY)

We’re pleased to announce that the vSphere Client is now ‘Fully Featured’ in vSphere 6.7 Update 1. This means that you can manage all aspects of your vSphere environment using the HTML5-based vSphere Client, no need to switch back and forth between the vSphere Client and the vSphere Web Client. We’ve ported all remaining features
