<p>I have always been a fan of the VMware Flings. There have been some great Flings in the past that eventually made it into VMware's products.</p>
<p>The most recent Fling I looked at is the "DRS Lens" which was released a couple of days ago. Yesterday I took the time to deploy the OVA in our IT-Lab and thought I'd share the results.<!--more--></p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>The installation is very straight forwards. All you have to do is define a IP Pool in your vCenter. (follow this link to know how to do it: <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.0/com.vmware.vsphere.hostclient.doc/GUID-5B3AF10D-8E4A-403C-B6D1-91D9171A3371.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Link</a>)</p>
<p>So basically you just deploy the OVA using the import wizard and define a IP for the appliance. In my case the first boot was very slow, I could not tell what it was doing exactly but it took quite a while to come online.</p>
<h2>First Step: Add your vCenter Server</h2>
<p>When the deployment completes you can either access the appliance over HTTP or HTTPS:</p>
<p>http://&lt;your-ip&gt;:8080/drs/app<br />
https://&lt;your-ip&gt;/drs/app</p>
<p>The first thing it will ask you is to point it to a vCenter. If you have multiple vCenter server you need to deploy multiple instances because I could not find a way to add more than one vCenter (version 1.0).</p>
<p>After that you configure the metrics that determine wether your VMs are happy or not. This is a swap and cpu wait metrix. I just used the defaults and moved on.</p>
<p>Next you will have to start the monitoring (and input credentials again) and configure for how long the monitoring should be active. For demo purposes I only chose 1 hour.</p>
<h2>Enjoy insight into DRS operations of your cluster</h2>

<p>on the "happiness" tab you can see if your vms were happy or not.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-179" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/screen-shot-2017-07-19-at-09-21-06.png" alt="Screen Shot 2017-07-19 at 09.21.06" width="2494" height="1208" /></p>
<p>here you can see the threshold of your drs cluster. during this test I changed drs to applying all recommendations (so I can see some action), this has caused the "tolerable inbalance" threshold to drop.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-178" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/screen-shot-2017-07-19-at-09-21-17.png" alt="Screen Shot 2017-07-19 at 09.21.17" width="2496" height="1200" /></p>
<p>as a result of my cluster settings change you can see the vmotions that have been triggered by drs.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-177" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/screen-shot-2017-07-19-at-09-21-28.png" alt="Screen Shot 2017-07-19 at 09.21.28" width="2502" height="1174" /></p>
<p>on the operations tab you have an overview of all the changes in your cluster (drs settings change, vmotions, vSAN stuff)</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>After playing with it for a little while I have to say I like the additional insights this fling provides. One use-case I can already see is that some customers don't want drs to move vms so much and with this fling they can monitor how many vmotions actually occur.</p>
<p>If you want to play with it as well feel free to download the fling from <a href="https://labs.vmware.com/flings/drs-lens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a></p>
<p>Update: Today they released version 1.1! According to the changelog you can now use 5.5 vCenters as well. Nice job. I actually tested on vSphere 6.0 Update 3 so I'll wait for the next release to update.</p>
