<p>We at <a href="https://www.business-it.ch/">BUSINESS IT AG</a> are proud to have just achieved the fourth Master Services Competency "Cloud Management and Automation".</p>
<p><img style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" title="msccma.png" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/msccma-1.png" alt="msccma" width="114" height="111" border="0" /></p>
<p><!--more-->It was a very exciting journey for us. As a relatively small but dedicated team, we had to pass five individual "VMware Certified Professional - Cloud Management and Automation" (VCP-CMA) exams and two individual "VMware Certified Advanced Professional - Cloud Management and Automation" (VCAP-CMA) exams. We even exceeded this goal with three VCAP-CMA exams.</p>
<p>We achieved this milestone by working together on our <a href="https://www.business-it.ch/#multi-cloud-experience-plattform-mep">Multi-Cloud Experience Platform (MEP)</a> and building on our expert knowledge. Our customers with whom we were able to implement projects in automation, orchestration and cloud management benefited most from this know-how. Three of these customers were willing to serve as reference for the required proof at VMware.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.business-it.ch/#multi-cloud-experience-plattform-mep">MEP</a> is a common MultiCloud environment of HPE, Veeam, Equnix, VMware and BUSINESS IT. It is currently the most modern MultiCloud platform with HPE infrastructure, with all VMware and Veeam software solutions, which BUSINESS IT hosts and further develops together with our partners for our customers.</p></blockquote>
<p>With the achievement of this fourth "Master Services Competency", we have achieved a status that few VMware partners worldwide can claim. This has allowed us to complete our VMware strategy - to deliver the best VMware service from A-Z to our customers, differentiating ourselves from the competition in the Swiss market.</p>
<p>With this fourth "Master Services Competency" we make a big commitment to our customers as well as to the VMware Professional Services Organization EMEA, for which we can offer our VMware services.</p>
<p>And now? Our devoted team is now dedicated to the fifth and final "Master Services Competence": "VMware Cloud on AWS".</p>
