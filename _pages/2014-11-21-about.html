<p>Hi! Welcome to my small blog, so glad you found your way here. I'm Dario and I run this blog.</p>
<p>I started blogging as a little hobby way back when in 2013 or 2014. I wrote about my experience with my first professional VMware bootcamp training. Looking back this was the kickstarter for my career in IT where I focus on VMware datacenter technology.</p>
<p>My career path started out where I finished my apprenticeship. I worked for four years in the internal IT of a big swiss retail firm and was handling the entire VMware stack of that company. The VMware infrastructure had grown so much in my four years there. I think we started out with around 20 ESXi hosts and when I left four years later we had 180 of them stretched across two datacenters.</p>
<p>Afterwards my path took me to the partner side where I focused even more on VMware technology and also wrote my first ESXi staging appliance which is basically a small linux with a php frontend for a dhcp/pxeserver to stage and configure ESXi hosts. I stayed in that position for four more years. At one point I felt like I had to take up a new challenge. The company I was with went through a merger where most of my colleagues left over the course of two years.</p>
<p>Recently, in may of 2019, I started my new position at BUSINESS IT AG in switzerland. My job is basically the same, I am part of the Professional Services team with a very strong focus on VMware technologies. However the new challenge here is that I will take up the technical leadership mantle for the entire automation stack. So basically vRealize Orchestrator in conjunction with vRealize Automation.</p>
<p>I am very glad for this opportunity and will be sharing as much as possible about the things that I learn now.</p>
<p>Another goal of mine is to achieve a VCDX certification. However I overestimated myself and underestimated the VCDX path at the same time and was so overwhelmed by it that my efforts in that regard came to a full stop. I will for sure give it another go but first I want to focus on my new role and the life beside the job.</p>
<p>Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or feedback or just want to tell me that my blog sucks. I blog to provide value and to give back to the community from which I have gained so much so if you feel like I should do something different just let me know. Any feedback is better than none from my point of view.</p>
<p>Looking forward to hear from you.</p>
