<p>I have been working a lot on my ESXi Staging Appliance lately. In version 1.0 you still had to go on the shell and set your ip address manually. I was wondering how VMware does it when they let you define the ip address during the OVA deployment wizard. So I started googling.</p>
<p>Some information on the side:</p>
<ul>
<li>I use ubuntu as the linux for my appliance</li>
<li>the appliance itself does not need any dns resolving so I don't configure dns servers</li>
</ul>
<p>After some google and a lot of reading I stumbled upon this blog post from 2014: http://www.v-front.de/2014/01/building-self-configuring-nested-esxi.html</p>
<p>This guy is doing the exact same thing as me, but he does it for a nested hypervisor deployment. Close enough, I think.</p>
<p>So what do you need to do to get your appliance equipped with an IP-address that you define during the OVA deployment wizard?</p>
<p>Basically the workflow is like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>you create your vm and enable vApp options in the settings of the vm</li>
<li>you create vApp properties for ip address, netmask and gateway</li>
<li>you define how these settings are being passed through to the vm</li>
<li>you write a short script which grabs this information and applies them to your vm</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But let's dive a little deeper into this..</p>
